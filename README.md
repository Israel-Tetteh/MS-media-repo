The Murashigue and Skoog (MS) media preparation protocol is a well
recommend protocol for preparing artificial media for Plant Tissue
Culture experiments.

Students offering Agricultural Biotechnology as a programme in KNUST
have to manually calculate for the various concentrations needed in
order to get a working solution for their experiments.

We aim to develop a function to help do that easily with the intention
on creating a shiny web app as an alternative for users not really
inclined in R.
