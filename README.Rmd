The `Murashigue and Skoog (MS) media` preparation protocol is a well recommend protocol for preparing artificial media  for Plant Tissue Culture experiments.

Students offering `Agricultural Biotechnology` as a programme in KNUST have to manually calculate for the various concentrations needed in order to get a working solution for their experiments.

We aim to develop a function to help do that easily with the intention on creating a shiny web app as an alternative for users not really inclined in R.

Below is the `MS media protocol` serving as a template for the  `MS_Media_Assistant function` 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
